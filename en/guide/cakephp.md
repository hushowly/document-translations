# CakePHP

CakePHP is an open-source web framework, following the MVC approach, which is one of the most popular frameworks in the PHP community.

This guide has been tested successfully in version `3.8`, I think it can be used older versions as well.

## Installation

Use PHP Composer:

```php
composer require terrylinooo/shieldon
```

## Implementing

### CakePHP 3

Step 1 and step 2 are applied to the same file located at `/config/route.php`.

#### 1. Register a Middleware.

As always, a middleware is ready for you.

```php
/**
 * Apply Shieldon Firewall tp the current route scope.
 */
$routes->registerMiddleware(
    'firewall',
    new \Shieldon\Integration\CakePhp\CakePhpMiddleware()
);

$routes->applyMiddleware('firewall');
```

#### 2. Define a Route for Firewall Panel.

```php
/**
 * Define the route for the firewall panel.
 */
$routes->connect('/firewall/panel/', [
    'controller' => 'FirewallPanel',
    'action' => 'entry'
]);
```


#### 3. Create a Controller for Firewall Panel.

Create a controller named `FirewallPanelController` and then add the following code into it.

```php
$firewall = \Shieldon\Container::get('firewall');
$controlPanel = new \Shieldon\FirewallPanel($firewall);
$controlPanel->entry();
exit;
```

If you have CSRF enabled, add these lines:

```php
$controlPanel->csrf(
    '_csrfToken',
    $this->request->getParam('_csrfToken')
);
```

The full example will look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

class FirewallPanelController extends AppController
{

    /**
     * This is the entry of our Firewall Panel.
     */
    public function entry()
    {
        // Get Firewall instance from Shieldon Container.
        $firewall = \Shieldon\Container::get('firewall');

        // Get into the Firewall Panel.
        $controlPanel = new \Shieldon\FirewallPanel($firewall);
        $controlPanel->csrf(
            '_csrfToken',
            $this->request->getParam('_csrfToken')
        );

        $controlPanel->entry();
        exit;
    }
}
```

You can access the Firewall Panel by `/firewall/panel`, to see the page, go to this URL in your browser.

```bash
https://for.example.com/firewall/panel
```
